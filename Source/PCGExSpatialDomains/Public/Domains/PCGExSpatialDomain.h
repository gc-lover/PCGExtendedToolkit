/**
 * Abstract spatial domain -- a queryable region for constraining placement
 * decisions. Domain-agnostic on the consumer side: callers pass a shape via
 * FPCGExFootprintShape and ask "does this overlap?" without knowing which
 * concrete impl backs the query.
 *
 * Subclass strategy:
 *   - Broadphase: heterogeneous mutable tracker, AABB-octree backed; the
 *     placed-modules domain in growth runs.
 *   - Polygon2D: static, single extruded prism (floor plans, room outlines).
 *   - SDF: static, voxelized signed-distance field (Phase-3 stub).
 *
 * Overlap math is shape-pair-typed and lives in PCGExSpatial::NarrowPhase --
 * adding a new shape kind is a pure addition (new shape USTRUCT + register
 * pair tests from a StartupModule). No edits to existing domains required.
 *
 * Convention: signed distance is negative inside, positive outside, zero on
 * surface. CSG-friendly: union = min(a,b), intersect = max(a,b),
 * subtract = max(a,-b).
 *
 * Lives in PCGExSpatialDomains -- generic infrastructure, not valency-
 * specific. Consumer modules add this as a public dependency.
