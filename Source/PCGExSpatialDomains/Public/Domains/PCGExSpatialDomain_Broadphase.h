/**
 * Heterogeneous mutable spatial domain. Single concrete impl that backs the
 * placed-modules tracker for generative growth runs -- shape-agnostic by
 * construction:
 *
 *   - Storage: parallel arrays of (FInstancedStruct shape payload, owner idx,
 *     cached narrow-phase tag, validity bit)
 *   - Broadphase: FDynamicCollection lensed as an AABB octree -- each entry's
 *     WorldAABB is added as an identity-orientation OBB, so the collection's
 *     SAT path collapses to AABB-vs-AABB (cheap, tight, no shape-specific math)
 *   - Narrow phase: PCGExSpatial::NarrowPhase 2D dispatch table, indexed by
 *     (CandidateKindTag, StoredKindTag) -- one array index + one branch per
 *     surviving pair.
 *
 * Adding a new shape kind requires zero edits here. Register pair tests via
 * NarrowPhase::Register from the shape's owning module's StartupModule;
 * the broadphase routes automatically once the kind has a tag.
 *
 * Owner identity:
 *   The OBB's Bounds.Index slot holds the entry's STORAGE index (into Entries[])
 *   -- not the owner index. Owner index is stored alongside the shape payload.
 *   The skip-by-owner ShouldSkip predicate lambda receives storage idx and
 *   resolves owner via Entries[idx].OwnerIndex internally; outward API still
 *   takes owner index from callers, matching the FPCGExSpatialDomain contract.
 *
 * Snapshot model:
 *   BeginSnapshotScope() returns Entries.Num() (high-water mark).
 *   RollbackToScope(handle) flips ValidMask bits past handle to invalid.
 *   O(1) amortized, no realloc, no per-entry walk on partial rollback.
 *
 *   GetBounds() may return an over-approximation after partial rollback:
 *   invalid entries' AABBs aren't subtracted out (that'd be O(N)). Consumers
 *   must treat GetBounds() as a cull hint, never a tight extent. Full rollback
 *   (Handle == 0) resets to empty.
