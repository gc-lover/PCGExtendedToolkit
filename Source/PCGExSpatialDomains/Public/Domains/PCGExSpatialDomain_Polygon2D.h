/**
 * Static spatial domain backed by a 2D polygon outline + height band,
 * authored on an arbitrary projection plane.
 *
 * Represents an extruded prism: a 2D outline lives in the XY of a
 * projection frame (rotation-only, no translation), with a Z band along
 * the projection-frame's normal. The default projection is identity, so
 * authored verts treated as world-XY behave as expected; for splines /
 * BestFitPlane sources the projection rotates the outline into the
 * spline's plane so queries respect the original spatial orientation.
 *
 * Common use: room floor plans on tilted ground planes, building
 * outlines, level-chunk perimeters where the source spline isn't
 * world-axis-aligned.
 *
 * Storage is owned (TArray<FVector2D> outline + FQuat projection +
 * ZMin/ZMax) -- decoupled from any backing PCG point data, so the domain
 * outlives the spline/PointIO it was baked from. MakeFromFPolyPath bakes
 * the projection from FPath::GetProjection() at construction time;
 * MakeFromOutline accepts authored 2D verts directly with an optional
 * explicit projection.
 *
 * Topology: arbitrary (concave allowed). Inside test delegates to
 * winding-number math. Closest-edge distance is naive O(N) -- fine for
 * typical room outlines (10-50 edges); add an edge octree later if
 * profiling justifies.
 *
 * Signed distance follows the unified convention (negative inside).
 *
 * Mutability: false. Append() check(false)s per the static-subclass policy.
