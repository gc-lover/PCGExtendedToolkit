/**
 * Marks an asset that wants its soft references force-cooked alongside itself.
 *
 * The cooker only follows hard references by default; soft refs held by a UDataAsset
 * are skipped unless explicitly added to the cook plan. Implementers expose their
 * soft refs via GetCookDependencyAssetPaths; the PCGExtendedToolkit ModifyCook
 * delegate scans every mount point for implementers, force-cooks each implementer's
 * own package, then force-cooks every path the implementer reports.
 *
 * Implementations should be cheap and pure -- the method runs during the cook
 * commandlet, after the asset has been loaded, and must not mutate state.
