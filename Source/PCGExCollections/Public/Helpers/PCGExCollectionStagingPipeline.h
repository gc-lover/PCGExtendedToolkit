/**
 * Editor-only post-process pipeline for asset-collection staging rebuilds.
 *
 * Subclass in C++ or Blueprint and add to UPCGExAssetCollection::StagingPipelines to
 * post-process entry data (property overrides, tags, weights, ...) whenever the collection's
 * staging data is rebuilt in the editor. Instanced via Instanced/EditInlineNew so derived
 * classes can expose their own UPROPERTYs directly in the collection's details panel.
 * Pipelines compose: every assigned pipeline runs in array order at each hook point (null
 * slots are skipped), so later pipelines observe earlier pipelines' mutations.
 *
 * Hook contract:
 *  - Fires for every editor rebuild session: toolbar Rebuild / Rebuild Recursive / Rebuild
 *    Project, single-entry restages (grid edits), stale-entry batches and property-edit
 *    triggered rebuilds. Pre/post fire once per session; OnProcessEntry fires once per
 *    restaged entry (Sanitize -> UpdateStaging -> PostUpdateStaging -> OnProcessEntry).
 *  - OnPostRebuild runs AFTER the native EDITOR_OnPostStagingRebuild extension point (actor
 *    component schema merges, shared-collection compaction), so the pipeline gets final say.
 *  - Subcollections recursed into via the runtime RebuildStagingData do NOT run their own
 *    pipelines; only the collection whose editor rebuild was triggered dispatches hooks.
 *  - Rebuilds triggered from inside a hook run WITHOUT re-firing hooks (no recursion).
 *  - Hooks never fire while cooking.
 *
 * Mutate entry VALUES only from OnProcessEntry -- never add or remove entries there, the
 * entry array is being iterated live. Structural changes belong in OnPreRebuild/OnPostRebuild.
 *
 * Events are declared unconditionally so Blueprint subclasses stay cook-safe, but they are
 * only ever invoked from WITH_EDITOR rebuild paths (the collection-side StagingPipelines
 * list is editor-only data and never exists in cooked targets).
