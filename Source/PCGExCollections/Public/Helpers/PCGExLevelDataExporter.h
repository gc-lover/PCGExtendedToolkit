 * Output state populated by UPCGExLevelDataExporter::ExportLevelData (rich C++ overload).

 * builds inline UPCGExMeshCollection / UPCGExLevelCollection and never writes Tag_EntryIdx
 * or the CollectionMap pin itself -- it captures contributions through these pointers and
 * leaves final hashing + CollectionMap emission to the caller.
 *
 * MeshLocalPicks layout (one int32 per "Meshes" pin point):
 *   low 16 bits  = local entry index into MeshContributions
 *   high 16 bits = secondary index + 1 (0 = no variant; matches FPickPacker hash convention)
 *   value == -1  = sentinel, no valid pick for this point
 *
 * LevelLocalPicks layout (one int32 per "Levels" pin point):
 *   value        = local entry index into LevelContributions (no secondary on levels yet)
 *   value == -1  = sentinel, no valid pick for this point
 *
 * Consumed by UPCGExPCGDataAssetCollection's shared-collection rebuild to merge contributions
 * across sibling entries and rewrite Tag_EntryIdx hashes against the deduplicated collections.

/**
 * Abstract base class for level → PCG data asset conversion.
 * Subclass in C++ or Blueprint to customize how a level's actors are
 * exported into a UPCGDataAsset during collection staging.
 *
 * Instanced on the collection via Instanced/EditInlineNew so that
 * derived classes can expose custom UPROPERTYs (filtering, transform
 * adjustments, etc.) directly in the collection's details panel.
 *
 * Two API surfaces:
 *  - BlueprintNativeEvent ExportLevelData(World, OutAsset): BP-facing, simple.
 *    Custom BP subclasses override _Implementation. No contribution capture; the
 *    resulting asset carries raw attributes (Mesh / ActorClass / LevelAsset) and no
 *    Tag_EntryIdx / CollectionMap. Standalone use only.
 *  - C++ virtual ExportLevelData(World, OutAsset, FPCGExLevelExportContext&):
 *    used by UPCGExPCGDataAssetCollection to capture editor-only mesh + level
 *    contributions that feed shared-collection compaction (CompactSharedMesh /
 *    CompactSharedLevel). The exporter never builds inline embedded collections,
 *    never writes Tag_EntryIdx, and never emplaces the CollectionMap pin --
 *    those responsibilities live on the caller. Default impl on the base forwards
 *    to the BP-facing path.
