 * material variant picking on mesh collections. One op is bound per MicroCache consumed in the
 * hot path; for typical use, a single op is created per factory and reused across entries by
 * re-binding the Target (cheap, since the op holds no per-target state beyond the pointer).
 *
 * Concrete subclasses implement Pick() with a tight, branch-minimal body.
