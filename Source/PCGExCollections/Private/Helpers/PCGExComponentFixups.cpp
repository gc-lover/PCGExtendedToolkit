		 * USplineComponent invariants that the per-property delta cannot express on its own.
		 *
		 * UE 5.7+ has two EditAnywhere spline properties that alias each other:
		 *   - `FSplineCurves SplineCurves` (legacy)
		 *   - `FSpline Spline` (new, experimental)
		 * `UE::SplineComponent::ShouldUseSplineCurves()` selects which one the runtime reads
		 * from for point queries. Authoring code keeps the two in sync, but the delta system
		 * serializes them independently: if the source only modified one side, only that side
		 * reaches the target, and the unchanged side reads back as archetype defaults. If the
		 * runtime then resolves against the unchanged side, the rendered spline looks reset
		 * to BP defaults.
		 *
		 * Strategy (5.7+): after the per-property delta is applied, diff each spline property
		 * against its archetype. If only one side diverged, call SetSpline() to rebuild the
		 * other from it (both overloads update both sides). If both agree or neither changed,
		 * leave them alone. If both changed but disagree, we can't pick a winner without
		 * losing data; leave as-is.
		 *
		 * In UE 5.6 the new `Spline` field is Transient + private and never appears in the
		 * delta; only SplineCurves is ever written, so no sync branch is needed -- only the
		 * reparam-table rebuild at the end.
		 *
		 * Always call UpdateSpline() to rebuild the transient reparam table -- it's
		 * CPF_Transient so the delta never includes it, and rendering/sampling depend on it.
