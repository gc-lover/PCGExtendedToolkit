 * with a wildcard output: the OutValue pin's actual type at compile time drives the
 * EPCGMetadataTypes conversion that the property's virtual TryWriteValue uses.
 *
 * The function is marked BlueprintInternalUseOnly so it doesn't surface in the
 * standard right-click palette -- UK2Node_GetPCGExProperty is the user-facing entry,
 * and it expands to a call to this function at compile time.
