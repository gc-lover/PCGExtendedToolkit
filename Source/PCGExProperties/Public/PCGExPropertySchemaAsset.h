 * Reusable schema asset.

 * Wraps an FPCGExPropertySchemaCollection so other collections can pull in a shared
 * set of property definitions through their own ImportedSchemas array. Because the
 * wrapped collection itself carries an ImportedSchemas array, composition is recursive.
 *
 * Resolution semantics (when imported into another collection):
 * - Name-keyed, first-wins. Locals in the importing collection beat imports;
 *   earlier entries in ImportedSchemas beat later ones.
 * - Walk order is depth-first: importing collection's locals first, then each
 *   ImportedSchemas entry expanded in array order (locals of the imported
 *   collection, then its own imports, etc.).
 * - Cycles are detected during resolution and skipped with a LogPCGEx warning.
 *   IsDataValid surfaces them in the editor as a Warning result.
