/**
 * Instance data preserved across Blueprint reinstancing for UPCGExPropertyCollectionComponent.
 *
 * UE's default per-instance UPROPERTY delta serialization is unreliable for the shape
 * FPCGExPropertySchemaCollection has -- TArray<FStruct> where each entry's Property is an
 * FInstancedStruct. Across a BP recompile, the captured delta either drops the polymorphic
 * inner-struct content or fails to re-apply it, leaving instances with CDO defaults and
 * silently wiping user-authored values.
 *
 * Diff-against-archetype capture: at GetComponentInstanceData time, walk the live collection
 * and capture only entries whose value differs from the matching archetype entry. This
 * matches UE's standard "instance-authored = differs from CDO" semantics that the broken
 * default delta path is supposed to provide (and would, if FInstancedStruct-in-TArray
 * round-tripped correctly). The instance-data cache holds these captured entries as live
 * in-memory structs (not as serialized bytes), so FInstancedStruct content survives the
 * reinstance gap intact.
 *
 * ApplyToComponent walks the captured divergences and overwrites the matching entries on
 * the freshly reinstanced (and structure-synced) component in the PostUserConstructionScript
 * phase. Effect: inspector edits win over CS writes for the same field, while CS writes that
 * match the CDO are not captured (so changing CS logic on the CDO between recompiles works
 * for any field the instance hasn't diverged on). The inner property's per-field reset arrow
 * is the un-stick mechanism -- resetting to CDO restores parity, the entry is no longer
 * captured next recompile, and CS regains control of it.
 *
 * The captured-divergence UPROPERTY arrays are WITH_EDITORONLY_DATA -- cooked builds don't
 * carry them, and the method bodies are WITH_EDITOR-gated to fall through to base behavior.
