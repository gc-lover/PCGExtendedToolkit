 * Dot-separated member path resolution against reflected containers.
 *
 * Resolves paths like "Weight", "AssetGrammar.SizingX.FixedSize" or
 * "ISMDescriptor.InstanceStartCullDistance" to a terminal FProperty and its value address.
 * Intermediate segments must be struct-typed properties; the terminal may be any property,
 * including whole arrays and whole structs. No array-index addressing ("Foo[2].Bar").
 *
 * Roots may be UScriptStruct (entry structs) or UClass (UObject members) -- both walk their
 * Super chain through FindFProperty. Segment names match the authored property names
 * (FProperty::GetFName), which is also what reflection-driven pickers emit.
